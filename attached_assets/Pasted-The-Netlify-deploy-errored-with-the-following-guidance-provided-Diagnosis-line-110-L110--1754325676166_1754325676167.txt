The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
[line 110](#L110), [line 114](#L114), and [line 127](#L127) indicate that there is a dependency installation error due to a Netlify Function failing to require one of its dependencies. Specifically, the error states that the module '../../shared/schema' cannot be found from the file "netlify/functions/contact.js".

### Solution
1. **Verify the Package**: Ensure that the missing module ('../../shared/schema') is present in the site's top-level "package.json" file or was committed to the repository.
2. **Add the Module to Package.json**: If the module is missing, add it to the "dependencies" section of the "package.json" file.
3. **Commit Changes**: After adding the missing module to "package.json", commit the changes and trigger a new build to resolve the dependency installation error.
