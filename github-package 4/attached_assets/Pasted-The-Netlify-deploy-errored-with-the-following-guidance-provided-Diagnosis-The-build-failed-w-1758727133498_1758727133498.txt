The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with the error message indicating that Rollup failed to resolve the import "/src/main.tsx" from "index.html". This issue occurred during the build process with Vite.

**Solution:**
- Verify that the file "/src/main.tsx" exists in the repository and is committed to the repo.
- Add the file "/src/main.tsx" to the `build.rollupOptions.external` configuration to explicitly externalize the module.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with Rollup failing to resolve the import during the build process.
